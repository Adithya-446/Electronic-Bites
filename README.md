# Combinational Logic Calculator

🚧 **Status: Work in progress** — currently building it.

I’m a 16-year-old junior building a calculator using combinational logic. My goal is to understand how real digital systems are built. This project documents my learning and the design process step-by-step. Every bit of help is appreciated.

Coding a calculator is a common project, and I’ve seen people do it. I wanted to go beyond software and build a calculator using electronic circuits and combinational logic. That’s what inspired me to start this project.
